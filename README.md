# Telecom-Customer-churn-rate-prediction

# Prediction of Churn rate of the Customers of Telecom company using Machine Learning Algorithms!
## Business Context :


_This case requires trainees to develop a model for predicting customer churn at a fictitious wireless
telecom company and use insights from the model to develop an incentive plan for enticing would-be
churners to remain with company. Data for the case are available in csv format. The data are a scaled
down version of the full database generously donated by an anonymous wireless telephone
company. There are still 7043 customers in the database, and 20 potential predictors._


_Candidates can use whatever method they wish to develop their machine learning model. The data
are available in one data file with 7043 rows that combines the calibration and validation customers.
“Calibration” database consisting of 4000 customers and a “validation” database consisting of 3043
customers. Each database contained (1) a “churn” variable signifying whether the customer had left
the company two months after observation, and (2) a set of 20 potential predictor variables that could
be used in a predictive churn model._


_Following usual model development procedures, the model would be estimated on the calibration
data and tested on the validation data. This case requires both statistical analysis and
creativity/judgment. I recommend you spend much time on both fine-tuning and interpreting results
of your machine learning model._


## _What i have done in this project -_
- Data cleaning including missing values, outliers and multi-collinearity.
- Describing my predictive churn model in elaboration.
- selecting variables to be included in the model.
- Demonstrating the performance of the model by using best set of tools.
- Making sure of the key factors that predict customer churn
- And try to figure out about if these factors make sense
- What kind of offers should be avail to customers to encourage them to remain with company?
- And at last, after the actions have been implemented,determining if they work?
